# Default package definitions for devcontainer image
# This file contains the default configuration that comes with the template.
#
# To customize without modifying this file:
#   1. Create a 'packages.custom.yml' file in the same directory
#   2. Use the same YAML structure (base/devenv sections)
#   3. Custom packages will be merged with defaults during Docker build
#
# Note: The base Docker layer includes only essential tools:
#   - curl, git, ca-certificates (via apt)
#   - yq, uv, bazelisk (downloaded via curl)
# Additional packages can be added to base.packages or devenv.packages below

# Base image configuration (using ECR Public mirrors to avoid Docker Hub rate limits)
image_name: public.ecr.aws/docker/library/ubuntu
image_tag: "24.04"

# Base packages (installed in base layer - kept minimal)
# Add packages here if they're needed in both production and development

# Development environment packages (installed in devenv layer only)
